# The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is known to be strongly related to the plant water content. It is therefore a very good proxy for plant water stress.  
# It is obtained by the following equation: NDWI = (NIR - MIR)/ (NIR + MIR). While using Sentinel-2 Band 8 (NIR) and Band 12 (MIR).
# Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR), Short Wave Infrared (SWIR).
# The NDWI is a vegetation index sensitive to the water content of vegetation and is complementary to the NDVI. 
# High NDWI values show a high water content of the vegetation.

# The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator of the greenness of the biomes, a proxy to quantify the vegetation amount.
# Even though it is not a physical property of the vegetation cover, it has a very simple formulation NDVI = (REF_nir â€“ REF_red)/(REF_nir + REF_red) 
# where REF_nir and REF_red are the spectral reflectances measured in the near infrared and red wavebands respectively, that makes it widely used for ecosystems monitoring.
# Using Sentinel-2 it is  expressed as (B8-B4)/(B8+B4).
# The NDVI is widely used by the bio-geophysical community to monitor the vegetation state and disturbances to address a large range of applications, 
# including forestry, agriculture, food security, water management.
# Very low values of NDVI (0.1 and below) correspond to barren areas of rock, sand, or snow. Moderate values represent shrub and grassland (0.2 to 0.3), 
# while high values indicate temperate and tropical rainforests (0.6 to 0.8).
